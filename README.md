# Smart Data Discovery – NYC 311 Service Request Analysis
This project is part of my coursework for the Smart Data Discovery module at London Metropolitan University in collaboration with Itahari International College. The aim of this project is to analyze and understand customer service requests in New York City using a real-world 311 dataset.

The focus lies in:

Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset,

Preparing and cleaning data efficiently,

Exploring and visualizing complaint patterns,

Conducting statistical tests to uncover meaningful insights.

Through Python programming, data wrangling, and visual storytelling, this project identifies key trends and relationships in citizen service complaints—ultimately laying the groundwork for more advanced data mining tasks.
